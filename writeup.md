## Submission Writeup

### Project overview

In this project, we will create a convolutional neural network to detect and classify objects in urban road environments. We will use the [Waymo Open Dataset](https://waymo.com/open/data/perception), which includes images of urban environments containing annotated vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. This dataset will be used to train the CNN using the [TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/object_detection). Appropriate data analysis will be conducted, and data augmentation methods will be applied to further improve the detection performance of the model.

### Set up
This section should contain a brief description of the steps to follow to run the code for this repository.

### Dataset
#### Dataset analysis
This section should contain a quantitative and qualitative description of the dataset. It should include images, charts and other visualizations.
#### Cross validation
This section should detail the cross validation strategy and justify your approach.

### Training
#### Reference experiment
This section should detail the results of the reference experiment. It should includes training metrics and a detailed explanation of the algorithm's performances.

#### Improve on the reference
This section should highlight the different strategies you adopted to improve your model. It should contain relevant figures and details of your findings.
